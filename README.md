# roman-numerals
To convert decimals to roman numerals and roman numerals to decimals

I wrote my code in c++ using cLion. One should be able to run my code by simply copying my main.cpp as that is the file that holds all the code. My code requires two inputs from the user: a valid roman numeral and then a whole number. Please notice the commented out portions of my code in main.cpp to understand my thought processes (as well as the roadblocks I came across) and for an explanation of the direction I was heading with my function to convert decimal numbers to roman numerals.

I started this project at 12:45 pm and stopped myself exactly 4 hours later, at 4:45pm. Please see my handwritten notes which are attached.
