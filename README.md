# roman-numerals
To convert decimals to roman numerals and roman numerals to decimals

I wrote my code in c++ using cLion. One should be able to run my code by simply copying my main.cpp as that is the file that holds all the code. My code requires two inputs from the user: a valid roman numeral and then a whole number. Please notice the commented out portions of my code in main.cpp to understand my thought processes as well as the roadblocks I came across. These commented out notes also give an explanation of the direction I was heading with my function to convert decimal numbers to roman numerals as I was unable to finish that one.

I started this project at 12:45 pm and stopped myself exactly 4 hours later, at 4:45pm. Please see my handwritten notes which are attached. Thank you and enjoy.
